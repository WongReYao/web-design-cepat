# web-design-cepat
This is an assignment for my web design subject where we learn to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design a website

This project is used to show the overall design of how each of the website should look like. 
Which means that this project does not include creating a user login system or using database to save data.

The zip file contains the website and all elements that are used for that website.
The first website that should be open to ensure the flow is smooth is the "Login.html" file. 
After opening that file, everything should be linked to each other file.
